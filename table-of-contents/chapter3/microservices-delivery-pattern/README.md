# Microservices Deployment Pipeline

We will guide you through two scenarios:

* Public cloud is focused on publicly exposed IaaS and PaaS. We will use PWS as a PaaS, and we will use AWS \(IaaS\) to host Articfactory. CircleCI will be used as continuous integration server.
* Private cloud is focused on privately installed PaaS and CaaS \(Containers as a Service\). We will use PCF dev, and we will use Docker to run Jenkins and Artifactory locally.

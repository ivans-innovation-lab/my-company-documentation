# Visualize your architecture {#architectural-overview}

I like [Software Architecture for Developers ](https://leanpub.com/b/software-architecture)by Simon Brown - a developer-friendly guide to software architecture, technical leadership and the balance with agility. Simon is also the creator of the [C4 software architecture model](https://structurizr.com/help/c4)** **and he built [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/), which is a collection of tooling to help software teams visualise, document and explore their software architecture.

The "C4 model" is a simple hierarchical way to think about the static structures of a **software system **in terms of **containers**, **components **and **classes **\(or **code**\).

> A **software system **is made up of one or more **containers **\(web applications, mobile apps, standalone applications, databases, file systems, etc\), each of which contains one or more **components**, which in turn are implemented by one or more **classes**.

Visualising this hierarchy is then done by creating a collection of **System Context**, **Container**, **Component **and \(optionally\) **Class **diagrams. Structurizr is an implementation of the System Context, Container and Component diagrams.

## System Context

This is a system context diagram for the 'My Company' application. A software system is the highest level of abstraction and describes something that delivers value to its users. This includes the software system you are modelling, and the other software systems upon which your software system depends.![](/assets/context-diagram.png)

# Monolithic Deployment Pipeline

Jenkins Pipeline is a suite of plugins which supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins. Pipeline provides an extensible set of tools for modeling simple-to-complex delivery pipelines "as code" via the [Pipeline DSL](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/).\[[1](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/#_footnote_1)\]

Typically, this "Pipeline as Code" would be written to a[`Jenkinsfile`](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/)and checked into a projectâ€™s source control repository, for example:

* [my-company-monolith](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-monolith)
* [my-company-common](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-common)
* [my-company-blog-domain](https://www.gitbook.com/book/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company/edit#)
* [my-company-project-domain](https://www.gitbook.com/book/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company/edit#)
* [my-company-blog-materialized-view](https://www.gitbook.com/book/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company/edit#)
* [my-company-project-materialized-view](https://www.gitbook.com/book/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company/edit#)

                    def version = pom.version.replace("-SNAPSHOT", ".${currentBuild.number}")
                    sh "mvn -DreleaseVersion=${version} -DdevelopmentVersion=${pom.version} release:clean release:prepare release:perform -B"

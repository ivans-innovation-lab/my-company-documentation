# [Infrastructure](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-infrastructure)

This chapter will guide you through two scenarios:

* [Public cloud](/chapter3/infrastructure-as-code/public-cloud.md) \(CircleCI, Public Artifactory/JFrog, PWS\)
* [Private cloud](/chapter3/infrastructure-as-code/private-cloud.md) \(Jenkins, Local Artifactory, PCF Dev\)

[Public cloud](/chapter3/infrastructure-as-code/public-cloud.md) is focused on publicly exposed IaaS and PaaS. We will use PWS as a PaaS, and we will use AWS \(IaaS\) to host Articfactory. CircleCI will be used as continuous integration server.

[Private cloud](/chapter3/infrastructure-as-code/private-cloud.md) is focused on privately installed PaaS and CaaS \(Containers as a Service\). We will use PCF dev, and we will use Docker to run Jenkins and Artifactory locally.

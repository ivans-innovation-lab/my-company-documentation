# Infrastructure

This chapter will lead you through installing an instance of Jenkins and Artifactory on a system. For this purposes we will use Docker to run Jenkins and Artifactory.

* Jenkins is the open source continuous integration server
* Artifactory is the open source maven repository
* Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications, whether on laptops, data center VMs, or the cloud.

You can find the source code here: [https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-infrastructure](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-infrastructure)

We will use [PCF Dev](https://pivotal.io/pcf-dev) / [PWS](https://run.pivotal.io/) to deploy applications on test, staging and production \(PWS\) environments.

## The scenario:

* all jobs are under version control and described via [Job-DSL](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki), see the [my-company-ci-jobs](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-ci-jobs) repo
* there is a [seed-job](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-infrastructure/blob/master/seedJob.xml) which runs periodically to ensure the aforementioned multi-branch jobs exist in Jenkins
* each project to be built by these jobs defines its own pipeline via [Pipeline-DSL](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/) in a`Jenkinsfile,(`Pipeline as Code`)` see the:

  * [my-company-monolith](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-monolith)
  * [my-company-common](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-common)
  * [my-company-blog-domain](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-blog-domain)
  * [my-company-project-domain](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-project-domain)
  * [my-company-blog-materialized-view](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-blog-materialized-view)
  * [my-company-project-materialized-view](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-project-materialized-view)

* artifacts are deployed on Artifactory instance. Parent maven [pom](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-common/blob/master/pom.xml) file is configured to use the Artifactory.

* deployable artifacts are deployed on test, staging and production environments.

### Running Jenkins and Artifactory

```
$ ./start.sh gituser gitpassword
```

Once Jenkins is started you should see at least the seed-job on [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090/).

If it has not run yet, simply trigger it and see how the actual jobs/pipelines get created.

Artifactory is available on [http://localhost:9091](http://localhost:9091/)

### Running PCF

You have to download and start PCF Dev. [A link how to do it is available here.](https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-tutorials/getting-started-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry-dev/install-pcf-dev)

The default credentials when using PCF Dev are:

```
username: user
password: pass
email: user
org: pcfdev-org
space: pcfdev-space
api: api.local.pcfdev.io
```

You can start the PCF dev like this:

```
cf dev start
```

Youâ€™ll have to create 3 separate spaces \(email admin, pass admin\)

```
cf login -a https://api.local.pcfdev.io --skip-ssl-validation -u admin -p admin -o pcfdev-org

cf create-space pcfdev-test
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-test SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-stage
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-stage SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-prod
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-prod SpaceDeveloper
```

### Adopt it

Please note that this scenario can be adopted to your needs:

* You can use some other virtualization tool, or choose not to use virtualization.
* You want to save Jenkins configuration \(docker volumes\)
* You want to create Jenkins slaves
* You like more Nexus then Artifactory
* You don't want to create and manage multi-branch jobs by yourself \([my-company-ci-jobs](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-ci-jobs)\). You want to use [Github Organization Folder Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-organization-folder-plugin)
* You want to use Groove \(script\) style of Jenkinsfile rather then declarative style.
* You don't want to use PCF as platform as a service \(PaaS\). You want to use container as a service \(CaaS\).

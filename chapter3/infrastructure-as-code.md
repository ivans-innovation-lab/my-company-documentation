# Infrastructure

This chapter will lead you through two scenarios:

* Private cloud \(Jenkins, Local Artifactory, PCF Dev\)
* Public cloud \(CircleCI, Public Artifactory/JFrog, PWS\)

Source code: [https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-infrastructure](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-infrastructure)

## The scenario - Private cloud

This scenario will guide you through installing an instance of Jenkins, Artifactory and Pivotal Cloud Foundry on your system. For this purposes we will use Docker to run Jenkins and Artifactory.

* **Jenkins** is the open source continuous integration server
* **Artifactory** is the open source maven repository
* **Docker** is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications, whether on laptops, data center VMs, or the cloud.
* **PCF Dev** is a small footprint distribution of Pivotal Cloud Foundry \(PCF\) intended to be run locally on a developer machine. It delivers the essential elements of the Pivotal Cloud Foundry experience quickly through a condensed set of components. We will use [PCF Dev](https://pivotal.io/pcf-dev) to deploy applications on staging and production environments.

### Deployment Pipelines

* all jobs are under version control and described via [Job-DSL](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki), see the [my-company-ci-jobs](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-ci-jobs) repo
* there is a [seed-job](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-infrastructure/blob/master/seedJob.xml) which runs periodically to ensure the aforementioned multi-branch jobs exist in Jenkins
* each project to be built by these jobs defines its own pipeline via [Pipeline-DSL](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/) in a`Jenkinsfile,(`Pipeline as Code`)` see the:

  * [my-company-common](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-common)
  * [my-company-blog-domain](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-blog-domain)
  * [my-company-project-domain](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-project-domain)
  * [my-company-blog-materialized-view](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-blog-materialized-view)
  * [my-company-project-materialized-view](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-project-materialized-view)

* artifacts are deployed on Artifactory instance. Parent maven [pom](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-common/blob/master/pom.xml) file is configured to use the Artifactory.

### Running Jenkins and Artifactory

```
$ ./start.sh gituser gitpassword
```

Once **Jenkins** is started you should see at least the seed-job on [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090/).![](/assets/Screen Shot 2017-03-28 at 11.52.40 AM.png)

If it has not run yet, simply trigger it and see how the actual jobs/pipelines get created \(Jenkins Blue Ocean\).![](/assets/Screen Shot 2017-06-14 at 10.47.14 PM.png)

**Artifactory** is available on [http://localhost:9091](http://localhost:9091/)![](/assets/Screen Shot 2017-06-14 at 10.45.24 PM.png)

### Running Pivotal Cloud Foundry

You have to download and start PCF Dev. [A link how to do it is available here.](https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-tutorials/getting-started-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry-dev/install-pcf-dev)

The default credentials when using PCF Dev are:

```
username: user
password: pass
email: user
org: pcfdev-org
space: pcfdev-space
api: api.local.pcfdev.io
```

You can start the PCF dev like this:

```
cf dev start
```

Youâ€™ll have to create minimum 2 separate spaces \(email admin, pass admin\)

```
cf login -a https://api.local.pcfdev.io --skip-ssl-validation -u admin -p admin -o pcfdev-org

cf create-space pcfdev-stage
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-stage SpaceDeveloper
cf create-space pcfdev-prod
cf set-space-role user pcfdev-org pcfdev-prod SpaceDeveloper
```

### Adopt it

Please note that this scenario can be adopted to your needs:

* You can use some other virtualization tool, or choose not to use virtualization.
* You want to save Jenkins configuration \(docker volumes\)
* You want to create Jenkins slaves
* You like more Nexus then Artifactory
* You don't want to create and manage multi-branch jobs by yourself \([my-company-ci-jobs](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-ci-jobs)\). You want to use [Github Organization Folder Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-organization-folder-plugin)
* You want to use Groove \(script\) style of Jenkinsfile rather then declarative style.
* You don't want to use PCF as platform as a service \(PaaS\). You want to use a container as a service \(CaaS\) layer.

## The scenario - Public cloud

This scenario will guide you through configuration of Artifactory, CircleCI and PWS. This tools are on the public cloud, and you don't need to install them or to manage them.

* [Artifactory](https://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/) as Maven repository on AWS
  * [http://maven.idugalic.pro](http://maven.idugalic.pro)
* [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) as continuous integration and delivery** **platform
  * [https://circleci.com/gh/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-common](https://circleci.com/gh/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-common)
  * [https://circleci.com/gh/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-blog-materialized-view](https://circleci.com/gh/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-blog-materialized-view)
  * [https://circleci.com/gh/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-project-materialized-view](https://circleci.com/gh/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-project-materialized-view)
  * [https://circleci.com/gh/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-blog-domain](https://circleci.com/gh/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-blog-domain)
  * [https://circleci.com/gh/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-project-domain](https://circleci.com/gh/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-project-domain)
* [PWS](http://run.pivotal.io/) - an instance of the Cloud Foundry platform-as-a-_service _ operated by Pivotal Software, Inc.

### Deployment Pipelines

Each maven project/repository defines its own pipeline in a[ circle.yml](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-monolith/blob/master/circle.yml) file:

* [my-company-common](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-common)
* [my-company-blog-domain](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-blog-domain)
* [my-company-project-domain](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-project-domain)
* [my-company-blog-materialized-view](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-blog-materialized-view)
* [my-company-project-materialized-view](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-project-materialized-view)

Artifacts are deployed on Artifactory instance in the cloud \(AWS hosted\). Parent maven [pom](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-common/blob/master/pom.xml) file is configured to use this instance with maven profile 'idugalic-cloud'.

### Adopt it

#### For public projects

[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) offer a total of four free linux containers \($2400 annual value\) for open-source projects. Simply keeping your project public will enable this for you! You can consider [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), it is free for open source as well.

#### For private projects

You can use CircleCI and Travis for private projects, but I would use [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product) and [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines). This Atlassian products are mature and very good integrated with Jira. I have to mention that [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) is coming strong as well. GitLab unifies issues, code review, CI and CD into a single UI.

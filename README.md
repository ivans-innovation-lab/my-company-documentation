# Introduction

For some executives, it’s about technology. For others, digital is a new way of engaging with customers.

It’s tempting to look for simple definitions, but to be meaningful and sustainable, I believe that digital should be seen less as a thing and more a way of doing things. To help make this definition more concrete, I have broken it down into three attributes: creating value at the new frontiers of the business world, creating value in the processes that execute a vision of customer experiences, and building foundational capabilities that support the entire structure.

## The trio - architecture, culture & process {#the-trio---architecture-culture--process}

To accomplish this we need the trio of microservices, DevOps, and continuous delivery.

* [Microservices](/chapter1.md) is the architecture,
* [A specific organization](//chapter2.md) — specifically CALMS \(collaboration, automation, learning, measuring, and sharing\)—is the culture,
* and continuous delivery is the [process](/chapter3.md).

The microservice architecture is merely a means to an end. The ultimate goal is to deliver better software faster. Today, that invariably means continuous delivery – for an installed product – or continuous deployment for an -aaS product.

The microservice architecture enables teams to be agile and autonomous. Together, the team of teams and the microservice architecture  enable continuous delivery/deployment.

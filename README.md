# Introduction

For some executives, it’s about technology. For others, digital is a new way of engaging with customers.

It’s tempting to look for simple definitions, but to be meaningful and sustainable, I believe that digital should be seen less as a thing and more a way of doing things. To help make this definition more concrete, I have broken it down into three attributes:

* creating value at the new frontiers of the business world, 
* creating value in the processes that execute a vision of customer experiences, 
* and building foundational capabilities that support the entire structure.

The main focus of this book is the third part of the definition - _building foundational capabilities that support the entire structure._

This foundation is made up of three elements: architecture, organization \(culture\), and process.

* Microservices is the [architecture](//chapter1/README.md),
* [Organization](//chapter2/README.md) — specifically CALMS \(collaboration, automation, learning, measuring, and sharing\)—is the culture,
* and continuous delivery is the [process](//chapter3/README.md).

The microservice architecture is merely a means to an end. The ultimate goal is to deliver better software faster. Today, that invariably means continuous delivery – for an installed product – or continuous deployment for an -aaS product.

The microservice architecture enables teams to be agile and autonomous. Together, the team of teams and the microservice architecture  enable continuous delivery/deployment.

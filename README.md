# Introduction

For some executives, digital is a new way of engaging with customers. For others, it’s about technology.

It’s tempting to look for simple definitions, but to be meaningful and sustainable, I believe that digital should be seen less as a thing and more a way of doing things. To help make this definition more concrete, I have broken it down into three attributes:

* creating value at the new frontiers of the business world, 
* creating value in the processes that execute a vision of customer experiences, 
* and building foundational capabilities that support the entire structure.

**The main focus of this document and this lab is the third part of the definition - **_**building foundational capabilities that support the entire structure.**_

This foundation is made up of three elements: software architecture, organization \(culture\), and process.

* Microservices is the [architecture](//chapter1/README.md),
* [Organization](//chapter2/README.md) — specifically CALMS \(collaboration, automation, learning, measuring, and sharing\)—is the culture,
* and continuous delivery is the [process](//chapter3/README.md).

The microservice architecture is merely a means to an end. The ultimate goal is to deliver better software faster. Today, that invariably means continuous delivery – for an installed product – or continuous deployment for an -aaS product.

The microservice architecture enables teams to be agile and autonomous. Together, the team of teams and the microservice architecture  enable continuous delivery/deployment.

## Source Code

The source code is hosted on the [Github](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab):

* [documentation](https://github.com/ivans-innovation-lab/my-company-documentation)
* business domain

## What you will learn

You will find the value of an architecture pattern language - specifically you will gain knowledge about many different patterns, and you will better understand the relations between them. This will enable you to make better discussions \(monolithic or microservices\).

You will learn how to visualize, document and explore  software architecture.

You will get your hands dirty with the code - we will implement fully functional monolithic application first, and after that we will migrate to alternate microservices architecture. You will find the answers on

* why we are migrating to microservices.
* how we are going to migrate to microservices and how it will influence on our organization and process.
* how can we design monolithic application to prepare better for easier migration to microservice in the future.
